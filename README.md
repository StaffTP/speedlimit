a fivem speedlimit script that draws text on your screen.

The script will show the speedlimit of your current street on the screen. The speed limit integer will turn yellow if you are 1-5 mph over the speed limit, Then it will turn red if you are any higher than 5mph.

Alternatively, If you know the basic of any programming language, I'm sure you can figure it out.
